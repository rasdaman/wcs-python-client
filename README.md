# Overview

The [OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs)
defines support for modeling and retrieval of geospatial data as coverages 
(e.g. sensor, image, or statistics data).

This Python library allows to extract information about WCS coverages from a
given WCS endpoint.
